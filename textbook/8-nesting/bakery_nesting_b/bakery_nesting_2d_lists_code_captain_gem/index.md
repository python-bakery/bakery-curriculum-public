The dread pirate **Captain the Cat** is once again sailing the seas looking for treasure. The seas are, of course, a 2D list of strings where each string is one character long (mostly just `"ðŸŒŠ"` emoji). However, one of the elements will be a `"ðŸ’Ž"` character, representing the treasure that Captain is looking for.

First, define a dataclass `Position` with the fields `x` (`int`) and `y` (`int`).

Then, define a function `find_gem` that consumes a 2D list of strings and produces a `Position` representing the x/y coordinate of the treasure character. Remember, the outer list is the `y` coordinate and the inner lists represent the `x` coordinate! You can trust that there is only one treasure per 2D list, and if the treasure is not found then just return the origin (`0, 0`) position.

Define a function `render_lights` that consumes a list of list of booleans and produces a single string. The 2D list of booleans represents a grid of lights that are either on (`True`) or off (`False`). You resulting string is going to be a sequence of two possible emoji (`"â¬›"` or `"ðŸ’¡"`), with each new row of the characters being separated by a newline. So for example:

```python
[ [ False, False, True, False],
  [ False, True, True, False],
  [ False, True, True, True] ]
```

Would become `"â¬›â¬›ðŸ’¡â¬›\nâ¬›ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡â¬›\nâ¬›ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡\n"`.

**Hint:** This is actually a fairly straightforward application of the Nested Accumulate pattern that was demonstrated in this chapter, only instead of adding numbers we are adding strings based on boolean values.

In this chapter, you will complete your first project of a substantial size. Remember, most code that you write will be a lot more than ten lines long. Learning how to put together bigger programs is an essential learning outcome for this course!

Do not be overwhelmed by the project. The instructions will seem long and daunting at first, but the whole point of Computer Science is that we break down difficult problems piece-by-piece. Start by reading over the instructions, and then try out the first part of the problem. Refer back to the instructions periodically (we recommend using the "pop-out" feature to have the instructions in a separate tab). By taking it step-by-step, you'll find this is all quite manageable. And if you need help, remember that there are many places you can seek help from - but do NOT share code with your classmates!

There isn't much else to say in this Primer. Go ahead and get started on the Project, it will explain the details!

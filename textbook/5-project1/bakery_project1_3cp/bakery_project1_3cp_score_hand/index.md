Define a function **score_hand** that accepts a (previously-sorted) list of three integers as described in the 3-card poker assignment, and returns the value as described in the project instructions. 

You may assume that the functions **has_pair()**, **has_triple()**, and **has_straight()** have already been defined. Use them!

Define at least three **assert_equal** tests for your function.

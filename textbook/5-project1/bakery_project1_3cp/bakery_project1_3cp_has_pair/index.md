Define a function **has_pair** that accepts a list of three integers as described in the 3-card poker assignment. Return True if the list has two identical numbers (a "pair"); otherwise, return False. You may assume the list is sorted from largest to smallest values.

Define at least three **assert_equal** tests for your function.

<p>Each line of the attached file is a pair of comma-separated last and first names (e.g., <code>washington,george</code>). Split each line, capitalize the first letter (use the <code>capitalize</code> method), and then print the names in the correct order (e.g., <code>George Washington</code>).</p>

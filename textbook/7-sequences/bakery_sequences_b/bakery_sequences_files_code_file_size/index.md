<p>Write a function <code>calculate_file_size</code> that consumes the name of a file as a string and returns an integer indicating how many characters long the file's contents is using the Count pattern (you may not use the built-in <code>len</code> function). Call your function on the files below to unit test. The rainfall file has&nbsp;891 characters, the names file has&nbsp;1064 characters, and the empty file has 0 characters.</p>

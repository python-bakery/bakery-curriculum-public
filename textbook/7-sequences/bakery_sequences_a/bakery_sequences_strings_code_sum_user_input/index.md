Recall the Input/Split/Loop pattern and the Sum pattern. Combine these two patterns to read in a comma-separated string of numbers from the user, separate each number, and then print the sum of these numbers. For example, if the user typed in the string <code>"10,20,30"</code>, your code should print <code>60</code>.

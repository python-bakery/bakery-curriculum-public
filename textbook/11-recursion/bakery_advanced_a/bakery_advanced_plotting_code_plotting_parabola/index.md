The built-in `range` function consumes an integer and returns numbers from 0 up until that integer. This can be used to plot mathematical expressions.

We have used the function to create a list of X values stored in the variable `xs` - now you can use that list to create a list of corresponding Y values, and then plot that list as a line plot that models the parabolic equation:

<pre style="padding-left: 20px">y = 10x - x<sup>2</sup></pre>

You do not need to label the graph.

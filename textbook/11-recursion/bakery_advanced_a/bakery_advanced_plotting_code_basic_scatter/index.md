Let us return to the salary data we saw a few problems ago. Previously, we looked at the distribution of the `mean_salary` data. Now we will compare that data with the `median_salary` data and then the `members` data to see if there are any correlations. Create *two* visualizations:

1. The first should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `median_salary` (y-axis)
2. The second should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `members` (y-axis)

Make sure you give meaningful labels to the axes and a title.

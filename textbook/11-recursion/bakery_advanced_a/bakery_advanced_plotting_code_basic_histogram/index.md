Create a list of at least ten numbers. These numbers can be high, low, the same, or different - it's up to you to choose the numbers. Represent this data as a list of numbers in your program, store it in a variable, and then create a Histogram to visualize their distribution. Title this Histogram as <code>"Distribution of Numbers"</code>. Make sure you understand how to interpret the histogram (and do not confuse it with <a href="http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/qq.09.99/raeluck1.html" target="_blank">a bar chart</a>). Consider trying out different values to see how it affects the Histogram's shape.

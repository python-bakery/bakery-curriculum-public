## Working in Groups

Often, humans learn more in groups than they do on their own. However, groups sometimes slow things down because no one knows what their job is. In this course, everyone will have a designated role in their group to make things more productive.

## Description of Roles

Here are the responsibilities of each role:

* **Manager**
    * Make sure group stays focused on the activity and watches the time.
    * Make sure all voices in the group are heard.
    * Makes sure the group all agree on responses to questions.
* **Speaker**
    * Communicates group questions and clarifications with the teacher or other groups.
    * Makes sure everyone had a chance to respond before asking for outside help.
    * Presents conclusions of the group to the class afterwards.
* **Recorder**
    * Creates and shares the Google Doc for the assignment.
    * Records the names and roles of the group members at the beginning of each activity. 
    * Records the group answers, discussions, insights, etc.

Anyone without a role helps the Manager make sure everyone has a voice.

## How to Assign Roles

Roles should change each week. Nobody should have the same role every week.

To help decide roles, here are the strategies you can use each week:

* **Week 1**: Sort yourselves alphabetically by last name. Match the order you were assigned to the roles above. So "Carol Danvers will be Manager", "David Marshal will be Speaker", and "Alice Zorro will be Recorder").
* **Week 5**: Sort yourselves based on your favorite movie alphabetically (e.g., "Carol likes Avengers" so she's 1, "David likes Harry Potter" so he's 2, and "Alice likes Mulan" so they're 3). Break tie with your second favorite movie. Match the order you were assigned to the roles above. In the example above, Alice would be Manager, Bob would be Speaker, and Carol would be Recorder.

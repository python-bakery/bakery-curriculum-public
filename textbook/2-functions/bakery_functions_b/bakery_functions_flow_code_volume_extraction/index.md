<p>
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is <code>height * area</code>.
The formula for the area is <code>PI*radius<sup>2</sup></code>.
Define the two functions below (<code>calculate_area</code> and <code>calculate_volume</code>)
 to use these formula to calculate the volume
of a cylinder with the given radius and height.
Fill in any missing blanks for the unit tests.
<p>
Note: It is okay to have <code>PI</code> inside your function definitions, 
even though it was defined outside. Since <code>PI</code> never changes its 
value (it is a "constant"), it is okay to access it out of scope.

Provide documentation for the following function. The function consumes a string, an integer, and a float; the function produces a boolean. Do not worry about the implementation of the function or its unit tests. You need to provide descriptions of the function, its arguments, and the return value, but they will not be assessed automatically; just do your best to explain them and focus more on getting the parameter and return types correct.

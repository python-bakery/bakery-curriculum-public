The function <code>calculate_perimeter</code> is meant to return the length of the outline of a rectangle by consuming its <code>width</code>&nbsp;and <code>height</code>. The code below is meant to call the function for a rectangle with the dimensions 4x3 and then unit test the result. However, it doesn't seem to work. Fix the function to obey scoping rules.

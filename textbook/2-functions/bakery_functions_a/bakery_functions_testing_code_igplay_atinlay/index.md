<p>Write a function <code>to_pig_latin</code> that converts a word into pig latin, by:</p><ol><li>Removing the first character from the start of the string,</li><li>Adding the first character to the end of the string,</li><li>Adding <code>"ay"</code> to the end of the string.</li></ol>So, for example, this function converts <code>"hello"</code>to <code>"ellohay"</code>. Unit test the function.
<p>You can assume that the strings will always be at least two letters long.</p>
<p><em>Note: Technically, this isn't real pig latin, since it doesn't handle vowels correctly. We'll learn how to do real pig-latin next week.</em></p>

You are developing a system for analyzing rainfall. The string below represents <code>"High"</code> and <code>"Low"</code> days for a creek in a week. Count and print the number of <code>"High"</code> days that are in the string. Using the [String function reference page](https://python-sneks.github.io/pages/v3_0/references/strings.html), find a method to help you solve this problem of counting the number of occurrences of a string in another string.

The following string was downloaded off the internet, and has numerous problems. Fix it by using methods you find in the [String functions reference page](https://python-sneks.github.io/pages/v3_0/references/strings.html). You will need to:

1. Strip spaces from the ends,
2. Replace dashes with spaces,
3. Title case the words, and then
4. Print the correctly formatted string.

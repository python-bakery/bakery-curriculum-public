<p>Write a function <code>begins_with_vowel</code> that consumes a non-empty string and returns whether the first character of that string is a vowel. A simple way to test if a single character is a vowel is to determine if it is in the string <code>"AEIOU"</code>. Keep in mind that your function should work for both uppercase and lowercase letters. Unit test the function to ensure that it works.</p><p>

<b>Note:</b> Do not use any <code>if</code> statements in solving this. That may seem impossible, but remember how you can use conditional operators by themselves!</p>

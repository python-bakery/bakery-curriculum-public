<p>Create a function named <code>make_polite</code> that takes in a string named <code>message</code> and returns it with <code>", please"</code> added to the end. Test the function by calling it on the following messages: "Pet the dog" and "Walk the dog". Make sure you unit test the function a suitable number of times!</p>

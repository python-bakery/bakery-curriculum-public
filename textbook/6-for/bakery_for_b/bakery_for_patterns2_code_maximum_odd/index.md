<p>Use the Min/Max pattern to write a function <code>maximum_odd</code> that finds the highest odd value in the list (consumes a non-empty list of numbers and returns a number). Use the provided helper function <code>is_odd</code> (that consumes a single number and returns a boolean indicating whether it is true or false). Do not change the helper function <code>is_odd</code>. Unit test both functions.</p>
<p>Note: You can assume there will always be at least one odd number in the list, and none of the numbers will be negative.</p>

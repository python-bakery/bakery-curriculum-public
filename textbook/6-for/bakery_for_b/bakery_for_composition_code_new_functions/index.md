Define at least four functions:

* `judge_cards` that consumes a list of strings representing cards and produces a list of integers, by converting the string `"club"` to 2 and `"spade"` to 3.
* `summate` that consumes a list of integers and adds them all together to produce an integer.
* `no_red_cards` that consumes a list of strings and produces a list of strings, without any occurrences of the values `"heart"` or `"diamond"`.
* `add_black_cards` that consumes a list of strings and produces the sum total of all the black cards' judged values.

One of the functions should compose all the other functions.

<p>Use the Accumulate pattern to write the function <code>all_true</code> function. This function consumes a list of boolean values and returns whether all of the values are True. Make sure to unit test this function. Solve this with the accumulation pattern, but do not use an IF statement.</p><p><i>Tip: What operator would you use to test if two boolean values are both <code>True</code>?&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Tip 2: If the list is empty, then you can assume that it is all true.</i></p>

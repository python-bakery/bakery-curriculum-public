Use the <code>replace</code> method on each of the following filenames to print the filenames with spaces instead of dashes.

You should refer to the [String Documentation page](https://python-sneks.github.io/pages/v3_0/references/strings.html) if you do not recall how the `replace` method works - remember, you only need to call it once per string.

<p>Use a <code>while</code> loop to repeatedly take <code>input</code> from the user and print whatever they type in. When the user enters the empty string (<code>""</code>), then your program should stop.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that if your program accidentally loops forever, your browser may become unresponsive for up to 15 seconds. Be very careful while writing <code>while</code> loops!</p>

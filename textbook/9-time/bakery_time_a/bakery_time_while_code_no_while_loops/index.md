Replace the <code>while</code> below with a <code>for</code> loop by using the built-in function <code>range</code>, which consumes a number and returns a list up to that number but not including it. For example, <code>range(5)</code> returns the list <code>[0,1,2,3,4]</code>. In the end, the code should print out the sum of the numbers from 0 to 99 (so your range function should go up to 100).

The following function <code>make_exclamations</code> is supposed to consume a list of messages and return a new list of messages with exclamations at the end (<code>"!"</code>). The function is defined and called twice, but as you can see, it seems to be returning the wrong value on subsequent runs. Diagnose the problem and fix the function's definition so that it returns the correct value each time.

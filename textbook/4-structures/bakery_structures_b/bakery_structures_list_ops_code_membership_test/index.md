You are developing a system to process lists of days of the week, represented as strings. Create a function <code>has_weekend</code> that consumes a list of strings and returns whether the list has the string <code>"Saturday"</code> or the string <code>"Sunday"</code> in it. Unit test this function with a list of days of the week.

To give the parameter type for a list of strings, use `list[str]`.

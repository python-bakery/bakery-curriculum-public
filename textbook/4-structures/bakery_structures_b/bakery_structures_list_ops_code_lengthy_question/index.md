The <code>len</code> function consumes a list and returns its length as an integer. Use the <code>len</code> function to write your own function <code>check_length</code> that consumes a list and returns whether it is 3-5 items long. Unit test and document your function.

Remember, the type parameter for a generic list is `list`. Sometimes you will need to specify the element type (like `list[int]` or `list[str]`) and others you will just know that you have a `list`.

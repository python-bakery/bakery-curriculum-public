The <code>random</code> module has a function named <code>choice</code> that consumes a sequence and returns an element chosen at random. Create a list literal of your four favorite dinner delivery spots in the area, store it in a variable, and then use this function to print one of them randomly (you are recommended, but not required, to get delivery from there for dinner tonight).

Define a function `make_cakes` that consumes an integer representing a number of cakes, and produces a `CakeIngredients` instance with the appropriate fields.

The `CakeIngredients` has four fields: `flour` (int), `eggs` (int), `milk` (int), and `sugar` (int). Each cake needs 3 flour, 1 eggs, 3 buckets of milk, and 2 piles of sugar.

One unit test has been provided to you.

A `Date` is a dataclass with the fields `day` (integer), `month` (string), and `year` (integer). Define the dataclass and then make two instances. One of the instances should be for the date `January 1, 1970` and stored in the `epoch` variable; the other `Date` should be stored in the `another_date` variable.

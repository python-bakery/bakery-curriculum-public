<p>The following three conditions test if the user is allowed to drink. Move the conditions into the given <code>if/else</code> statements to make the code correctly print out whether the user can drink. Make sure you delete the old conditions after placing them into the code. Initialize the variables with values appropriate to yourself (or make up the details, we don't want to pry).</p>

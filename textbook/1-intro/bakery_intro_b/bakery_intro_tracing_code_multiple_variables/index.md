The program below is meant to calculate how much time an *entire* trip will take, based off a few variables:

* time_spent_so_far
* distance_travelled
* distance_left

Finish the two variable assignments with the appropriate math operations so that the total distance (not just the remaining distance) is determined.

HINT: Speed is distance divided by time. Correspondingly, you can divide distance by speed to determine how long it will take to travel that distance.

You are calculating the cost per square foot of the boxes below.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JZhKqAZ.png">

* Total Cost = $100
* Area = Width * Height
* Dollar Cost Per Square Foot = Total Cost / Area

Arrange the following expressions so that they successful calculate the formula above and print the result. You should not edit any of the blocks, just connect them and arrange them (or in terms of code, do not change any values or variables, just replace the blanks).

If you have been using the text view, you may find it easier to complete this problem in the block view. Remember that some blocks may have scrolled out of view!

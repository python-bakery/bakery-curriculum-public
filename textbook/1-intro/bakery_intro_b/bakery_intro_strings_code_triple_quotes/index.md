Copy the Text Art at <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/V7tWn1Rj" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/raw/V7tWn1Rj</a>
and use triple quoted strings (e.g.,&nbsp;<code>"""this style"""</code>) to print it to your console.
Be sure that you do not add any new lines or adjust the picture.

Pro-tip: Use CTRL-A (Windows) or COMMAND-A (Mac) to select all text on a screen.
Then you can right click and copy it.

If you get a syntax error with single triple quotes ('''), you can use double quotes instead.

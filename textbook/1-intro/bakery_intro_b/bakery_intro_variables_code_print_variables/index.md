For this program, you need to create variables to represent different kinds of data. Then, you will need to print out those variables.

Here are the variables and their values that you need to encode:

1. A variable `my_favorite_color` that contains a string value representing your favorite color.
2. A variable `hours_worked` that contains an integer value representing how many hours you've worked on this course today.
3. A variable `money` that contains a float value representing how much money you have on your person right now.
4. A variable `having_fun` that contains a boolean value representing whether or not you are enjoying yourself.

We have already provided an example for you: a variable named `question` that contains the string value `"1B1.1) Print Variables"`.

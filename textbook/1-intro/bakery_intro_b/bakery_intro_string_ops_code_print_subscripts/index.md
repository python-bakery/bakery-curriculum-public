Using the string variable provided, write `print` statements to print the result of the following indexing and subscripting operations (in order):

1. The third character of `word`
2. The third character from the end of `word`
3. The first five characters of `word`
4. The third through fifth characters of `word`
5. The last four characters of `word`

Fun fact, every one of these is a valid English word!

HINT: Get out a piece of paper, write out the word with boxes around each character, and then write numbers directly below each box and directly above each dividing line. These numbers will make indexing and subscripting much easier!

For this exercise, write three **print statements** that display either `True` or `False` depending on the condition given. Here are the three statements you'll be creating:

1. print whether 8 is greater than the number of days in a week
2. print whether 60 is less than 100 *and* less than 50
3. print whether the year 2023 is **not equal to** the year 2015

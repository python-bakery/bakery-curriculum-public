The "INPUT" block below retrieves input from the user. Notice how it can connect 
on the left? Connect a "PRINT" block to it, then try running the program.

When the program runs, a box appears in the Console area.
You will need to enter your favorite animal into that "Input" box and then press the "Enter" button.
Whatever value you enter will be printed as output, also in the Console area.

This simple program demonstrates how data comes in via the user (e.g., typing into a console input box), is processed
by the program, and then goes out back to the user (e.g., by printing in the console area).

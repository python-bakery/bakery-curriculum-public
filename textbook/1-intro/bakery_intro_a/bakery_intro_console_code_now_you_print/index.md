Now you will write your own Python program.
Drag the PRINT block in the "Output' category and the green STRING LITERAL 
block in the "Values" category onto the canvas in order to print the phrase `"This is programming!"`. 
Be sure to observe the Python code that you wrote on the right!

Hint: The STRING LITERAL block is the green block with quotation marks.

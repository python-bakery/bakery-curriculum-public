## What is "Computer Science"?

![The words Computer Science crossed out, with the word Problem-solving in a banner underneath](intro_cs_what_is.png)

Computer Science is not really about computers, and it is not really a science.
Instead, Computer Science is more about solving problems.
Although we use many tools, Computer Scientists most common tool is Programming.

## What is "Programming"?

![A robot staring at a piece of paper with instructions on it ](intro_cs_what_is_programming.png)

A program is a series of concrete instructions that can be carried out by a computer.
A program can be thought of as a script for a play, that will be performed by actors who follow instructions perfectly but without any intelligence of their own.[^1]

## Alternate Terms

* Programs
* Software
* Applications
* Scripts
* Code

Just a note on terminology: Programs are sometimes called "Software", "Applications", "Code", and "Scripts".

## Programs are everywhere

There are many kinds of programs that you use everyday - your web browser, your music player, and even video games.
Programs can be run on laptops, phones, cars - almost everything runs programs now.

## Programs do many things

Programming now shows up in every field, from engineering to the sciences to even the arts and humanities.
Regardless of whether you want to be a Computer Scientist or just someone who knows a bit about programming, this is a skill that will come in handy.

## Is programming magic?

You might think that some of the things that computers do are mysterious, but everything they do is the result of very careful instructions.

## Limitations

![Comic illustration of a man and a computer both thinking "Can't you do anything right?"](intro_cs_limitations.png)

Although programming is very powerful, computers are not gods.
In fact, programs can only do what people have told them to do.
You must be very clear and explicit when writing programs.

## Core Idea

![An arrow connecting Earth and a Computer, signifiying their relationship](intro_cs_abstracting.png)

Fundamentally, a program takes some representation of the world, manipulates it by following instructions, and then presents the results to the user. This core idea of translating between reality and digital data is the very heart of what we do.

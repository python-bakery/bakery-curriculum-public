We can use Python to represent information from the real world. Inside of each of the following `print` statements, there
is a literal value representing something from the real world. However, the values are incorrect. Change the values
so that they accurately reflect the following:

* The number of days in a week
* The name of a shape with three sides
* How much money a Penny is worth, in dollars
